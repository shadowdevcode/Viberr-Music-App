## How does it work?

To get started, first create a new album. When adding an album cover logo, it's best to have a resolution of at least 512x512 and to use common image formats such as JPG, JPEG, or PNG.

## My Songs

Once songs are added to an album you are then able to play, favorite, and delete them.
